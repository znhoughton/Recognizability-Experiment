# Recognizability-Experiment

Data and scripts for the paper titled "The effects of predictability on the recognition of *up* in English multi-word phrases" (in press).

Analysis scripts can be found in the Analysis folder. The models generated in this folder will be stored in the Models folder (the models are too large to store there, but they can be generated from the analysis script).

The processed data can be found in the Data folder as well as the list of sentences and frequency/predictability/cloze predictability calculations. The raw data is too big to be committed to this github repo. If you wish to see this, feel free to contact the first author directly at znhoughton@ucdavis.edu.

The raw sound files for the stimuli can be found in the Stimuli folder.
